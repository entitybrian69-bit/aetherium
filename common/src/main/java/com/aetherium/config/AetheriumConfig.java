 * produces a deterministic GUI.
 *
 * <p>Keys are {@code group.name}; {@link #byGroup(String)} powers the sidebar
 * tabs. Instances are created once in {@link #createDefaults()} and shared —
 * {@code Aetherium.config()} hands out the one live instance, matching how
 * Sodium's {@code GameOptions} singleton works. Never construct a second copy
 * at runtime: listeners bound by the GUI would be orphaned.</p>
